## 2024-05-23 - Outliner Visibility Toggle Missing Styles
**Learning:** The Outliner's visibility toggle was implemented as an unstyled `div` with no content, rendering it effectively invisible to users. This highlights the risk of relying on class names that are assumed to exist but aren't verified in CSS.
**Action:** When implementing UI controls, always verify the visual representation exists. Prefer semantic `<button>` elements with explicit text/icon content over empty divs relying on background images unless strictly necessary.
