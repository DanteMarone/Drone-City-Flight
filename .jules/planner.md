# Planner Journal

## 2025-05-15 - Initial Setup Decision: Formalizing the Plan
**Rationale:** The project lacked a central planner journal (`.jules/planner.md`), which is required by the role instructions. I am establishing this file to track strategic decisions moving forward.
**Action:** Created this file. Verified that `PROJECT_STATUS.md` is largely accurate but needs minor tweaks.

## 2025-05-15 - Roadmap Confirmation Decision: Focus on Organic Curves
**Rationale:** The "Next Up" item "Organic Curve Support" is logically the next step after the grid-based infrastructure tools (Smart Road, Intersections) were completed. This unlocks non-grid city layouts which is a key differentiator.
**Action:** Confirmed "Organic Curve Support" as the priority. Will update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to be explicit about dependencies.
