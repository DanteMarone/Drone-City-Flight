# Planner's Journal

## 2025-05-15 - Initial Assessment
**Decision:** Standardize Infrastructure and Plan Organic Curves.
**Rationale:** The project has successfully implemented "Smart" tools for straight roads and rivers. The next logical step, as identified in the roadmap, is to support organic curves (Bezier) to break the grid monotony. I will define the spec for this.
**Action:** Create `docs/specs/005-organic-roads.md` and update status.
