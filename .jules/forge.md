## 2026-01-08 - Cactus Entity [Visuals] [Action]
**Discovery:** `CapsuleGeometry` combined with `THREE.Group` allows for constructing complex organic shapes like Saguaro cacti without external assets. Procedural `CanvasTexture` with vertical stripes effectively simulates organic ribs.
**Action:** Implemented `CactusEntity` using `CapsuleGeometry` for trunk/arms and `CanvasTexture` for skin. Registered in `index.js`.
